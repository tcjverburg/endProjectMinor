## Application Purpose
When going out and one wishes to go out for diner, it is often tough choosing a restaurant. Even when you look up a specific restaurant, the ratings given will most likely be given by people you do not know or gave an anonymous rating. However, when someone you know recommends a specific restaurant, you are more likely to be convinced by their opinion and make a quick decision on where to eat. Therefore, I created an app which uses your geo location to see what restaurants are near, and by logging in with facebook sees if any of your facebook friends have been there and left a positive review or are even checked in at that moment.

## Data sets and sources
The data set that are going to be used will be generated by the users themselves. The reviews will then be saved using the live Firebase database. For sources, I mainly used StackOverflow and the Android Developers Website. However, there are a couple of large sources I used to make my application:

### LoginActivity
To use the login with facebook combined with Firebase, I used and adapted this source code to implement the login feature.
source:https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/blob/master/auth/app/src/main/java/com/google/firebase/quickstart/auth/EmailPasswordActivity.java

### NearbyRestaurantsActivity
This was the trickiest activity. The first source I used was to get the current location of the user, and the second source was to
get the nearby restaurants to the location of the user.

### MyAsyncTask
This is from a tutorial I used to perform a HTTP request to the Google Places API Webservice.

## Seperate parts of the application
The first part of the application will be the login part using facebook. Following this, there will be a screen which shows a list of restaurants based on their distance from the user. The user will also then be able to navigate to several other screens. The user can select a restaurant which opens a new screen which shows information about the restaurant, ratings of friends, friends that are checked in and a small map with the location of the restaurant. In this screen, the user can toggle the checkin/checkout button and the user is prompted to leave a rating after they check out. Furthermore, the user can access an activity which shows their previous reviews and an activity which shows all their friends using the app.
