##Monday 09-01
Decided on what kind of application I wanted to make and what features I wish to include. Furthermore I discussed with several of my
class mates what I could further implement or do to make the application more convenient. Based on this new information,I wrote the
proposal of my application with a couple of sketches of how I imagine the application to look like.

After having received feedback, I came to the conclusion that my app mainly depends on the ability to get friends who use the application.
This is easiest when the application would import all of your facebook friends, and thus I have decided to focus today on figuring out how 
this works. At the end of the day, I had connected Firebase to Facebook and my project.

Today I tried going through several tutorials and seeing how you implement logging in with facebook and getting the friends list. As of 
now, I am able to log in using facebook but I am still having trouble with getting the friends list.. It seems as if Facebook only allows
the names of friends who also use the application so my plan is to make a new facebook account to test this.

##Thursday
For today, I had the goal to finish my technical design, finish the prototype and start with the Firebase database. All of this has been accomplished but I am only now starting the realise the scope of the app I want to make, especially since I haven't even looked at the Google Maps API.
