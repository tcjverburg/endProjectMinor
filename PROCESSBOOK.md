##Monday 09-01
Decided on what kind of application I wanted to make and what features I wish to include. Furthermore I discussed with several of my
class mates what I could further implement or do to make the application more convenient. Based on this new information,I wrote the
proposal of my application with a couple of sketches of how I imagine the application to look like.

##Tuesday 10-01
After having received feedback, I came to the conclusion that my app mainly depends on the ability to get friends who use the application.
This is easiest when the application would import all of your facebook friends, and thus I have decided to focus today on figuring out how 
this works. At the end of the day, I had connected Firebase to Facebook and my project.

##Wednesday 11-01
Today I tried going through several tutorials and seeing how you implement logging in with facebook and getting the friends list. As of 
now, I am able to log in using facebook but I am still having trouble with getting the friends list.. It seems as if Facebook only allows
the names of friends who also use the application so my plan is to make a new facebook account to test this.

##Thursday 12-01
For today, I had the goal to finish my technical design, finish the prototype and start with the Firebase database. All of this has been accomplished but I am only now starting to realise the scope of the app I want to make, especially since I haven't even looked at the Google Maps API.

##Friday 13-01
This morning we had the presentations of our prototype. Based on feedback, I will continue with the design I have so far, except for the incheck option. According to the observers, this feature will probably cost me too much time.

##Weekend 14-01 and 15-01
In the weekend I made connection to the Google Places API and the Google Maps API and implemented them into my application. Still needs a lot of work concerning the query but the start has been made. 

##Monday 16-01
Today I was able to succesfully implement the Google Places API and get all the necessay information to connect the users for the Firebase Database. My plan for tomorrow is to try and save the first reviews and connect them to specific restaurants and users(writers of the review). 

##Tuesday 17-01
Today I did not have that much time to work on the project, seeing as I had a lot of trouble getting to Amsterdam. However, I was able to save more data to Firebase and plan to find a way to read this data tomorrow. 

##Wednesday 18-01
The plan for today was to finish the alpha seeing as the only real challenge ahead was reading the Firebase data and I succeeded in this. For tomorrow I do not have anything planned, except finishing the style sheet with my group.
