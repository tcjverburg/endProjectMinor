# Report
## Create a report (REPORT.md), based on your design document, containing important decisions that youâ€™ve made, e.g. where you changed your mind during the past weeks. This is how you show the reviewer that you actually understand what you have done.

----------NearRestaurantActivity----------

## Descriprion
The application is designed to use your geo location to see what restaurants are near, and by logging in with facebook sees if any of your facebook friends have been there and left a positive review or are even checked in at that moment. By clicking on one of the markers, as the ones you see in the image, you are navigated to an activity which shows information about the restaurant, reviews left by friends, the option to check in and write a review.

## Complete Functionality
The first part of the application will be the login part using facebook. Following this, there will be a screen which shows an activity feed of what their friends have done recently. This is either written a review, or checked in in a restaurant. In the next activity there is a map with restaurants based on the location of the user. The user will also then be able to navigate to several other screens. The user can select a restaurant which opens a new screen which shows information about the restaurant, ratings of friends and friends who are checked in. In this screen, the user can toggle the checkin/checkout button and the user is prompted to leave a rating after they check out. Furthermore, the user can access an activity which shows their previous reviews and an activity which shows all their friends using the app.

## Technical Design
### Clearly describe the technical design: how is the functionality implemented in your code? This should be like your DESIGN.md but updated to reflect the final application. First, give a high level overview, which helps us navigate and understand the total of your code (which components are there?). Second, go into detail, and describe the modules/classes and how they relate.
First of all, there are 8 activities. One for each screen and a BaseActivity which is the Superclass of all the other activities, with the exception of LoginActivity.  There is 1 CustomArrayAdapter class for implementing a RatingBar, 1 AsyncTask class to do a HTTP request for the Google Places API Webservice, 1 Review class and 1 AppConfig  class which makes NearRestaurantActivity less messy. This is how the entire structure looks like:

<img src="https://github.com/tcjverburg/endProjectMinor/blob/master/doc/new_design.png" width=100%>

This BaseActivity makes for less duplication of code and has a listener which directs the user back to the login screen, if the user is no longer logged in. This is convenient for the creating of the Actionbar, mAuthStateListener and methods like the getListAdapter which are used through out different activities. This means that all Activities are in one way or another related to BaseActivity. The actionbar is only used so the user can sign out at any moment they are in the application by clicking the signout button in top right hand corner. 

LoginActivity makes connection with Facebook and handles the Facebook acess Tokens. When Authentication is succesful, the application first requests the permissions for the app to function. These are access to email, name and friendslist. Following this, the users Facebook friends who use the application are saved under their Facebook ID to Firebase. The user is then navigated to FriendsListActivity. 

FriendsListActivity shows you a list of all the activities your friends have done in a single ListView. This is done by reading out the entire friends list from Firebase and seeing where these ID's have checked in and what reviews they have written. If a check in of one of these friends is more than 24 hours ago, the check in is removed from Firebase. By clicking on the items in the list, the user is either directed to a SelectedRestaurantActivity or a ReadReviewActivity if they click on a check in event or a write review event respectively. 

NearRestaurantActivity is the activity which shows the Map fragment. In the onCreate, all the permissions are checked for accessing and requesting the current location of the user . After  the map is created and the Google API client is built, the location is used to query Google Places API Webservice for restaurants near the user. The API then returns 20 of the most relevant restaurants in the radius of 1km of the user and adds them as locationmarks on the map. This is done immediately after the avtivity is created, so the result is that the user immediately sees a map with several markers. When the user


## Challenges
### Clearly describe challenges that your have met during development. Document all important changes that your have made with regard to your design document (from the PROCESS.md). Here, we can see how much you have learned in the past month.

There were several challenges allong the way, but I have overcome most of them. First of all I had to put a lot of trouble in getting the Facebook SDK working in the first week. Seeing as logging in with Facebook wasn't enough (seeing as I had to get the friendslist as well), it took quite some reading and research to figure out how I could get the friendslist of the current user. Even though it took quite a while (and the Facebook SDK only gets a Facebook friendlist of existing users who use the app), I decided on still implementing this feature. 

Concerning the Google API's I only had trouble seeing as I reached the quota when experimenting with requesting the location and sending a query to the Google Places API Webservice. At first, I did not understand why the API was failing, but after doing some research and visiting the Google console, I figured out that my continuous requesting of the location was to blame. This happened Monday 30-01, so it stressed me out thinking that I broke the API in one way or another, seeing as I got error messages that made no sense. Seeing as a constantly requesting the location was not an option, I decided on adding a refresh button on top of the map fragment that recreates() the activity. 

The Firebase structure also gave me a lot of headache in the second and third week. In the first week I had made a design of how I thought I wanted it to look, but after 2 weeks I had altered this design so much, that the end result is nowhere near the same. In the second week I had trouble because I had to start from scratch, and it took me quite a while to get a structure which saved the reviews in a way that worked for my application. In the third week I wanted to save the check in/out as well, and this caused my to add various rules to my database. Furthermore, at the end of the third week I decided on adding the activity feed which also resulted in a lot of stress and work to create a clean database structure.

The reason I wanted to implement an activity feed of all your friends, was because I had an activity (FriendsActivity) which only showed a couple of friends who also use the app, but there were no other features. Several people who used the app in the third week said that, if I had the time, I should try to implement some sort of functionality, so I would not have an empty activity. Seeing as the goal of the application was about the ratings of restaurants of your friends, I decided not to implement a chat function. After all, these are people you know and can contact via messenger. So, I came to the conclusion that I wanted a feed which showed all the activity of your friends concerning the application. 

## Discussion
### Defend your decisions by writing an argument of a most a single paragraph. Why was it good to do it different than you thought before? Are there trade-offs for your current solution? In an ideal world, given much more time, would you choose another solution?

## Make sure the document is complete and reflects the final state of the application. The document will be an important part of your grade.


## Seperate parts of the application
The first part of the application will be the login part using facebook. Following this, there will be a screen which shows a list of restaurants based on their distance from the user. The user will also then be able to navigate to several other screens. The user can select a restaurant which opens a new screen which shows information about the restaurant, ratings of friends, friends that are checked in and a small map with the location of the restaurant. In this screen, the user can toggle the checkin/checkout button and the user is prompted to leave a rating after they check out. Furthermore, the user can access an activity which shows their previous reviews and an activity which shows all their friends using the app.

## Features
To solve this problem, there are a couple of features which are essential for this problem to be solved. First of all, the user needs
to be able to log in using facebook. Secondly, the user needs to see what restaurants and their ratings are near and see if any of their 
friends are checked in. Thirdly, the user needs to be able to check in and out when in a restaurant and give a rating after they have 
checked out. Finally, the user should be able to see their own reviews and see what friends of theirs use the application.
