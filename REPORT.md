## Seperate parts of the application
The first part of the application will be the login part using facebook. Following this, there will be a screen which shows a list of restaurants based on their distance from the user. The user will also then be able to navigate to several other screens. The user can select a restaurant which opens a new screen which shows information about the restaurant, ratings of friends, friends that are checked in and a small map with the location of the restaurant. In this screen, the user can toggle the checkin/checkout button and the user is prompted to leave a rating after they check out. Furthermore, the user can access an activity which shows their previous reviews and an activity which shows all their friends using the app.

## Features
To solve this problem, there are a couple of features which are essential for this problem to be solved. First of all, the user needs
to be able to log in using facebook. Secondly, the user needs to see what restaurants and their ratings are near and see if any of their 
friends are checked in. Thirdly, the user needs to be able to check in and out when in a restaurant and give a rating after they have 
checked out. Finally, the user should be able to see their own reviews and see what friends of theirs use the application.
